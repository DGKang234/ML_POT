How to use the code: <br>
```python GULP_GAP.py '{eigvec 1} {eigvec 2}...{eigvec n}' {step size for the lambda} {from what IP rank structure} {to what IP rank structure} {n or y (whether including the breathing config or not)} {GAP cutoff parameter} {GAP n_sparce parameter}```
<br>
**Example**: ```python GULP_GAP.py '7 9 12' 10 1 10 n 3.0 100```

```GAP_1_gulp.py```: Preparing IP structures (IP optimised structures, breathing configurations, IP optimised structures + (eigenvector*Î») <br>
It will consider degenerate frequencies to select only one frequency which is to avoid the overfitting the potential energy landscape. <br>
(It will select first frequency among the degenerate frequencies for the training. For example, 7 and 8 are degenerate, then it will use 7th frequency(eigenvalue/eigenvector))
<br>
***N.B.*** At the moment 100 % of dataset will be distributed as a training dataset if you want to distribute some to validation/test set please change from **line 133**.

```GAP_2_fit.py```: Fitting the GAP potential on the prepared GULP training data

```GAP_3_vis.py```: Visualise the potential from QUIP output using ```plotly```; potential energy VS interatomic potential
(it shows the ideal potentials that we want to reproduce, GAP potentials (cation-anion and anion-anion), RDF of the training data configurations, transparent-boxed interatomic distance region (green/red) that covered by the training data (cation-anion/anion-anion) 

```gap_3_vis_hist.py```: same as ```GAP_3_vis.py``` but visualise interatomic distance in histogram manner rather than RDF.

*The script will be further modulised for numerous purpose. If you have any questions about the project please ask me*
