```gulp_1_gulp.py```: Preparing IP structures (IP optimised structures, breathing configurations, IP optimised structures + (eigenvector*Î»)

```gulp_2_fit.py```: Fitting the GAP potential on the prepared GULP training data

```gulp_3_vis.py```: Visualise the potential from QUIP output; potential energy VS interatomic potential
(it shows the ideal potentials that we want to reproduce, GAP potentials (cation-anion and anion-anion), RDF of the training data configurations, transparent-boxed interatomic distance region (green/red) that covered by the training data (cation-anion/anion-anion)
